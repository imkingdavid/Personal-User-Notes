Personal User Notes

A phpBB 3 MOD that allows forum users with the appropriate permissions
to create personal notes within the UCP, visible only to them. These can
contain emoticons and bbcode, just like a forum post.

Also, if given permission, users are able to easily, with one click, post
a note as a new topic into a forum into which the user has topic posting
access.
